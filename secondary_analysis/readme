# Secondary analysis for the DMReproduciple pipeline

This directory contains the workflow to run secondary analysis for the DMReprodicible pipeline.

This involves:

- Trimming the reads.
- Deduplicating the fastq files.
- Merging fastq files by sample.
- Mapping the fastq files to the reference genome.
- Extracting methylation data into portable beta files.
- Running quality control checks.
- Identifying differentially methylated regions between sample groups.
- Annotating DMR data with gene features.
