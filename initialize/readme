# Initialize the DMReproduciple pipeline

This directory contains the workflow to set up the DMReprodicible pipeline.

This involves:

- Downloading the reference genome (specified in the config file)
- Indexing the reference genome for use with the programs bwa-meth, bismark, fastq-screen, and wgbstools
- Downloading the desired fastq files from SRA (specified by the user in the samples.tsv file)
